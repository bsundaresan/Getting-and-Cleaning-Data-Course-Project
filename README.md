Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository contains the script to get and clean data obtained  
from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung S Smartphone
available on UCI database.

It also contains a codebook that details the variables, transformations
and functions used to perform the same

The R script called run_analysis.R performs the following functions:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

3. Uses descriptive activity names to tag the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
   for each activity and each subject
